# PlanningX
A Website to create and analyze various projects/tasks.

It can also be used to display the projects you have participated in.

100% free to use.

### How it works:

- Enter project-data (Name, Type, Workstyle, Agile?, Time, ...)
- It analyzes everything for you
- Gives you a overview for active tasks/important appointments
- Sends you (if wanted) notifications via mail to inform you
- Create a profile to show every project you've participated in (Good for applications)
